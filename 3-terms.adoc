////
For the purposes of this report, the definitions specified in Clause 4 of the OWS Common Implementation Standard https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=38867&version=2[OGC 06-121r9] shall apply. In addition,
////

The following terms and definitions apply:

* dataset

 collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats [W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)]

NOTE: The use of 'collection' in the definition from DCAT is broader than the use of the term in WFS 3.0. See the definition of <<feature_collection,'feature collection'>>.

* distribution

 represents an accessible form of a dataset [W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)]

NOTE: Examples are: a downloadable file, an RSS feed or a web service that provides the data.

* feature

 abstraction of real world phenomena [ISO 19101-1:2014]

NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with the term 'feature', the explanations in
the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice document cite:[SDWBP]
may help, in particular the section on
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#spatial-things-features-and-geometry[Spatial Things, Features and Geometry].

[[_feature_collection]]
* feature collection | collection

 a set of features from a dataset [OGC Web Feature Service 3.0: Part 1 - Core]

NOTE: In WFS 3.0, 'collection' is used as a synonym for 'feature collection'. This is done to make, for example, URI path expressions shorter and easier to understand for those that are not geo-experts.

* OpenAPI definition | OpenAPI document

 a document (or set of documents) that defines or describes an API and conforms to the OpenAPI Specification [derived from the OpenAPI Specification]
